\section{Datasets}
Datasets are split in REAL or SYNTHETIC and are based on the 
the source of the routing table:
\begin{itemize}
    \item REAL-Tier-1-A: real core backbone router in a global tier-1 ISP
    \item REAL-Tier-1-B: national backbone router in research and educational network of WIDE Project.
    \item SYN1: each procedure that is no longer than /24 and /16 is split
    into two and four prefixes
    \item SYN2: Each prefix that is no longer than /24, /20 and /16 is split into two, four and eight prefixes
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Notation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item binary radix depth: longest prefix matching
\end{itemize}

\section{Traffic Patterns}
Take the following traffic patterns into consideration:
\begin{itemize}
    \item random: $2^32$ random traffic patterns (generated by xorshift).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item overhead for generating the data is included in the measurements, 
        but it is small.
    \end{itemize}
    \item sequential: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generates in the range 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
    \end{itemize}
    \item repeated
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Similar to random but each random lookup is repeated $16$ times
        \end{itemize}
    \item real-trace
    \begin{itemize}
        \item real traffic trace
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
